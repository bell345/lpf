                <h1>Why Linux?</h1>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons to switch to a free and open source operating system, such as Linux.
                    For one, both most of the programs written for Linux as well as the entire operating system
                    is COMPLETELY free to use by anybody for any purpose and can also be modified in any way.
                    This leads to an environment which can be extended and modified at a whim.
                </p>

                    Speaking of programs, Linux also takes a different approach to installing applications.
                    In other operating systems such as Windows, most programs are only available from the 
                    developer or publisher's website and must be installed manually. Linux, however, uses
                    something called a <em>package manager</em>. A package manager is a command line 
                    application that automatically handles the installation, upgrading and configuration
                    of all of the programs installed on the computer. An example for this is to compare
                    what a user needs to do to install a new program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To install a new application on Windows, one first has to either purchase the program
                    online or in-store and then either download the program to the user's hard drive or insert
                    a CD/DVD.
                    Once this is completed, a Windows user must double click on either the <code>.exe</code>
                    file downloaded to their hard drive or the drive in which the program's CD/DVD is inserted.
                    On Linux, one only has to type the following into a terminal emulator:
                </p>
                <pre class="para terminal"><code>sudo pacman -S &lt;program name&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Another big advantage is the fact that Linux can be customised and modified in any way
                    imaginable. You're not stuck with just one desktop environment, or just one icon set, 
                    or one set of window borders. Instead, a Linux user can use and install any number of
                    these and more. An example is the variety of desktop sessions you can use; including
                    Unity, GNOME, KDE, XFCE, LXDE and Openbox. A gallery of vastly different Linux setups
                    is shown below.
