                <p>
                    The Linux Proliferation Foundation was established in 2014 by Thomas Bell to provide an all-in-one
                    guide to the world of Linux. It provides resources to learn about Linux, choose the distribution
                    that is right for you and how to set it up once you have it.

                    In reality, this website is an ICT project made by <a href="http://bell345.github.io">this guy</a>.
                    We were <em>supposed</em> to use Dreamweaver, but I found it clunky and used plain HTML instead. It
                    was also a nightmare to get this working on the Web, since it doesn't have its own domain (but
                    the testing version does), uses a completely different branch and Git is difficult to use
                    with a school proxy.
