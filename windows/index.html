                <h1>Linux vs Windows</h1>
                <p>
                    Another way to look at Linux is to view the features of both Windows and Linux and to compare
                    and contrast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most obvious difference is the price: Linux costs nothing to use, share or modify anywhere,
                    while Windows's source code is not revealed to the public (in other words, it is proprietary
                    software) and you have to pay to license the software (sometimes in excess of AU$100!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linux also affords a level of freedom that Windows either hides or plain does not have. The 
                    user can access and edit every level of the system's configuration. This may be potentially
                    dangerous to those who are not knowledgeable, but many people can offer support, especially
                    on such sites as <a href="http://superuser.com">Superuser</a> and <a href="http://askubunutu.com">
                    Ask Ubuntu</a>. On Windows, configuration is often hidden and incomprehensible and often requires
                    violation of warranty or legitimacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as a level of unprecedented freedom, Linux takes a modular approach to software upgrades.
                    In a Linux system, every single component is independent of each other, and if one has a security
                    vulnerability or an urgent update, only the specific component needs to be upgraded. In Windows,
                    that same security vulnerability could be left in the program for days before it gets pushed to
                    Windows Update, and even then the computer has to be restarted or core system programs modified 
                    in some way.
