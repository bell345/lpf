                    <h1>What is Linux?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Linux, put simply, is an open-source operating environment. It performs the same function
                        for a computer as Windows or Mac OS X, except that it is free to use, distribute and modify
                        in any way imaginable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What sets it apart is not only its price; Linux is highly customisable, and people can 
                        choose from any number of <em>distributions</em>, which are different implementations
                        of the underlying Linux operating system that contain different programs, features and 
                        levels of support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is a highly popular version of Linux
                        that millions of people use everyday. It is considered to be the most reliable and 
                        easy to use Linux distribution due to its intuitive user interface, 
                        assistive applications, support and similarities 
                        to many other GUI operating systems, such as Windows.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, <a href="http://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> is a barebones installation
                        of Linux, with only a few essentials which provide a foundation for lots of other programs
                        that the user can install. It is considered to be a complex version of Linux because it 
                        doesn't hold your hand and can easily lead to a personalised system with only the programs
                        and features that the user requires.
                    </p>

                        As you can see, each distribution of Linux can be a world away from another, and there are
                        hundreds to choose from, such as Debian, Mint, Gentoo and Red Hat. Linux offers a unique
                        computing experience that is geared towards the user's preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like what you can see? You can try and install Linux and any number of different distributions
                        right from this very website. If you are new to Linux, then I recommend a feature-packed
                        distribution, such as Ubuntu or Mint. Find out how <a href="/get">here</a>.
