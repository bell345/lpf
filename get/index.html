                <h1>Get Linux</h1>
                <p>
                    Installing a new operating system can be a bit daunting for first-timers, but once
                    you get the hang of it, it's actually quite simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can choose a couple of different methods to install Linux. If you want to
                    simply try out Linux you can install it into a <a href="#vm">virtual machine</a>,
                    which is pretty much a computer within a computer. If you want to exclusively
                    use Linux, you can <a href="#overwrite">overwrite your existing Windows
                    files</a>, and if you want to <a href="#dual-boot">boot both Windows and Linux</a>,
                    you can dual-boot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whichever method you choose, you have a couple of preliminary steps that you need to
                    complete below.
                </p>
                <ol class="main">
                    <li>Pick which <a href="/get/distros">distribution</a> of Linux you wish to use.</li>
                    <li>
                        Download a disk image file, known as an ISO file. They will usually be from 500MB
                        to 2GB in size.
                        <ol>
                            <li>To check which version you should download, press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
                                and type in "msinfo32", then press Enter. In the field "System Type", it should
                                say something along the lines of either "x64-based PC" or "x86-based PC".</li>
                            <li>
                                Download the "x64" or "64-bit" file if it says the former, or download the
                                "x86" or "32-bit" file if it says the latter.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2 id="vm">Virtual Machine</h2>
                <p>
                    A virtual machine is not only good for installing Linux. It is also handy to try other
                    operating systems without using an actual PC and to experiment with setups that may risk
                    your computer's integrity.
                </p>
                <ol class="main">
                    <li>
                        Install the virtual machine software of your choice. I recommend using
                        <a href="http://virtualbox.org" class="external">Oracle VM VirtualBox</a>.
                        It's free, and has a lot of powerful features. The following instructions will use
                        VirtualBox, but these can be extended to other software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a new virtual machine by clicking on the "New" button. In the box that
                        appears, choose "Linux" as the operating system type and your distribution
                        and architecture (either 32-bit, x86 or 64-bit, x64). Give it any name
                        you wish.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Some Linux distributions are not listed. In this scenario, either
                                pick the distribution that yours draws from (Kubuntu draws from
                                Ubuntu, for example) or the "Other Linux" option.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose how much memory you wish to give to the virtual machine. The default
                        of 512MB is fine to test Linux out, but you may wish to give it 1024MB for a
                        faster experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a hard drive file. Choose the "Create a hard drive now" option and click
                        "Create".
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                There is a few options that you may wish to configure. On the first screen,
                                you can choose what file type the hard drive will be. This will make no
                                difference in this case, so just click "Next".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You can now choose between "Dynamic" and "Fixed" allocation. "Dynamic" will
                                grow the file as needed (up to a certain point), but will not shrink when
                                files are deleted. "Fixed" will create a file of a specified size on your
                                operating system that will not change in size. Choose your preference, then
                                click "Next".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now choose how large the file will be. The default is 8GB, and is completely
                                fine to try out Linux. You may wish to allocate more to install more programs,
                                but keep in mind that this will take up hard drive space on your host computer.
                                Click "Create" to finalise the process.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The new virtual machine should now be selected. Click on "Settings" to configure the
                        machine. For now, click on the Storage tab to set up the ISO you downloaded.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Under "Controller: IDE", there should be an empty slot with a disc icon. Click on this
                                and then on the disc icon with a small arrow next to the "CD/DVD Drive: " drop-down
                                box.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once more, click on the "Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file" menu item and browse to
                                your ISO. It should be in your "Downloads" folder.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Click "Open" on the file dialog and "OK" on the settings dialog to save your settings.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now, start the virtual machine (by clicking on "Start") and follow the instructions to install
                        Linux. The virtual machine may run slower than if you installed it on a proper PC, simply because
                        you are running it on top of another operating system.
                    </li>
